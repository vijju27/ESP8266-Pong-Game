# ESP8266-Pong-Game
A fun project about bring a vintage pong game console small in size on a esp8266 using Arduino IDE.
This game is created with a library [U8g2lib](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) made by olikraus, A special thanks to him.
The code works on any version of ESP8266 dev board, should work on arduino too (i haven't tested yet). Remember to change the PIN connections and numbers according to your board.
